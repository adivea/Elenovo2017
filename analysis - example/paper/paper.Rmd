# Introduction

In their article on looting in Jordan, Contreras and Brodie critique the reluctance of the Wadi Faynan survey project to engage with the interpretative and ethical problems raised by the archaeological site looting (2010, 103). While archaeologists may point to finite time and resources, and other investigative priorities, ignoring looting comprises an archaeological blindspot. In this article we make looting the object of archaeological research and investigate the patterns in its spatial extent, impact at individual sites and community reactions. Our data result from pedestrian survey, which is one of the best means of investigating looting on the ground and informing the relationship between cultural heritage monuments, their natural environment and modern communities.

This article reports on the field verification of burial mounds documented in topographic maps from 1970-80s. Burial mounds are ubiquitous features in the Bulgarian landscape, with estimates for their number fluctuating near 15,000 for the entire country [REF needed]. Burial mound construction spans from the Early Bronze Age to the Roman period, with secondary use extending to Mediaeval period. Burial mounds look alike across time, the period of construction can only be ascertained upon excavation. They can be distinguished from settlement mounds by the absence of prehistoric material, their conical shape and regular round or slightly elliptical plan. The diameter of a mound may range from 15 to 150 m ( Mezzek?) and height from 0.5 to 25m, however, majority of mounds fall in the 2-3 m tall and 20-40 m diameter group.  Mound mantle is built with earth or stones. Sometimes this mantle will be be encircled by a wall of standing large stones, a krepis. The contents vary according to period and the status of deceased; Bronze Age tumuli contain simple pit graves with crouched burials sometimes surrounded with rock circles (Boyanovo, Iliev and Bakardzhiev). Early Iron Age mounds especially in the Sakar mountains and Rhodopes may contain megalithic structures serving as communal/family graves. Late Iron Age mounds may contain simple inhumations in cists or elaborate ashlar tombs accompanied by a wealth of burial goods, additional structures and decorations (Sveshtari, Alexandrovo, Golyama Kosmatka). The variety is immense as one might expect from an early agricultural society. A small percentage of mounds contain no human burials at all. They may have served ritual purpose (Agre 2016) or other military and infrastructure needs (Jochmus, sphakteriai) [REF NEEDED].

Hundreds of these mounds have been excavated and much of the remaining ones have been tampered with in recent past (Eftimovski et al 2017, Weissova 2016, Loulanski and Loulanski 2017), but the regional variation in factors impacting mounds is not known. This study reports on a brief campaign of two weeks during which 8 team members visited and verified some 414 suspect mounds in the Tundzha River watershed, recording the anthropogenic and natural impact on burial mounds, and providing a state of the art digital dataset for the study of interaction between local communities and cultural landscapes.

## Study Area

Our study area centers on the northern half of the Yambol province in SE Bulgaria. This area comprises a NE section of the Thracian plain in the watershed of the Tundzha River. The Thracian plain is one of the archaeologically richest areas in modern Bulgaria, with conspicuous material culture ranging from 6000-7000 BP to the Ottoman period with several thousands of burial mounds dating from the Bronze Age to the Roman period.  The plain occupies much of central and southeastern Bulgaria, defined roughly by the watershed of two major rivers, Maritsa and Tundzha (ancient Hebros and Tonzos), which converge just before the border with Turkey.  The Balkan range (ancient Haemus)  forms the northern boundary of the plain, Rhodope mountains bound it to the south and Strandzha mountain in southeast. Extensions of the plain stretch to the Marmara Sea in the south and the Black sea in the east. The relief of the plain is flat and only occasionally disrupted by volcanic outcrops, such as  the Kabyle hill, Sveti Ilija uplands, Manastirski uplands and a number of small ridges which serve as orientation and viewpoints across the plain. Deep humic layers produced by the alluvial activity of the rivers as well as warm Mediterranean climate make the Thracian plain one of the largest fertile areas north of the Mediterranean. 
Area covered in September 2017 was bounded by Stara Planina shields near Lozenetz, boundary of Yambol to the East, Sveti Ilija range to the West and the Manastirski vazvishennia to the South. 

# Methodology
This project employd digital approaches at every stage of work from initial data aggregation, digitisation, to field verification and documentation. The fully digital workflow allowed for both integration of suspect features from a variety of legacy topograhic maps, as well as efficient verification and comprehensive field documentation during an exceptionally short field season.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

In Table \@ref(tab:carstab) we can see some data about the relationship between pressure and tempurature. We can reference the table by the ID of the code chunk that produces the table, like this: `\@ref(tab:carstab)`

```{r carstab}
library(knitr)
kable(head(mtcars), caption = "Data about cars")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressureplot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Plot of car data"}
plot(pressure)
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:pressureplot) we can see some data about pressure. We can cross-reference the figure like this: `\@ref(fig:pressureplot)`, using the chunk ID as the key to link the cross-reference to the figure. 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Citations and References 

We can have a citation, using a `.bib` file that holds all the details. To get this: [@Marwick2016repro] we type `[@Marwick2016repro]`. The text after the `@` is the bibtex key that links the in-text citation to the full details in the `.bib` file.

All of the usual variations on in-text citation formatting are possible in markdown, and listed for reference here: <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html>

### Customising

After cloning this repo, I can replace 'researchcompendium' by the name of the new repo in every file where it occurs with this line in my bash terminal:

```
find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' {} +
```

I also need to switch on the new repo at <https://travis-ci.com/>, <https://circleci.com/> & <https://hub.docker.com> and enter my details so that circle-ci can push to docker hub


### Colophon

This report was generated on `r Sys.time()` using the following computational environment and dependencies:

```{r}
# which R packages and versions?
kable(data.frame(Setting = names(devtools::session_info()$platform),
                 Value = sapply(devtools::session_info()$platform, `[`, 1),
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                 row.names = NULL),
      caption = "R session information")
```



```{r}

      caption = "Packages that this report depends on")

# what commit is this file at?
library(git2r)
repo <- repository(path = "../..")
last_commit <- commits(repo)[[1]]
```

The current git commit of this file is `r last_commit@sha`, which is on the `r branches(repo)[[1]]@name` branch and was made by `r last_commit@committer@name` on `r when(last_commit)`. The current commit message is "`r last_commit@summary`".
